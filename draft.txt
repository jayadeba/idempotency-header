                   The Idempotency HTTP Header Field
                      draft-idempotency-header-00

Abstract

   The "HTTP" Idempotency request header field can be used to carry
   idempotency key in order to make non-idempotent "HTTP" methods such
   as "POST" or "PATCH" fault-tolerant.

1.  Introduction

   Idempotence is the property of certain operations in mathematics and
   computer science whereby they can be applied multiple times without
   changing the result beyond the initial application.  It does not
   matter if the operation is called only once, or 10s of times over.
   The result "SHOULD" be the same.

   Idempotency is important in building a fault-tolerant "HTTP API".  An
   "HTTP" request method is considered "idempotent" if the intended
   effect on the server of multiple identical requests with that method
   is the same as the effect for a single such request.  [RFC7231]
   defines methods "OPTIONS", "HEAD", "GET", "PUT" and "DELETE" as
   idempotent.  However, "POST" and "PATCH" methods are "NOT"
   idempotent.

Internet-Draft      The Idempotency HTTP Header Field      November 2020


   Suppose a client on "HTTP API" wants to create or update a resource
   using "POST" method.  Since "POST" is "NOT" an idempotent method,
   calling it multiple times can result in duplication or wrong updates.
   What would happen if you sent out the POST request to the server, but
   you get a timeout?  Is the resource actually created or updated?
   Does the timeout happened during sending of the request to the
   server, or while receiving the response on the client?  Can we safely
   retry again, or do we need to figure out first what has happened with
   the resource?  If "POST" was an idempotent method, we would not have
   to answer such questions.  We could safely resend a request until we
   actually get a response back from the server.

   For many use cases in "HTTP API", creation of duplicate records is a
   severe problem from business perspective.  For example, in Fintech
   industry, duplicate records for requests involving any kind of
   payment transaction on a financial account "MUST NOT" be allowed.  In
   other cases, processing of duplicate webhooks due to retries is not
   warranted.

1.1.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   This specification uses the Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF)
   notation of [RFC5234] and includes, by reference, the IMF-fixdate
   rule as defined in Section 7.1.1.1 of [RFC7231].

   The term "resource" is to be interpreted as defined in Section 2 of
   [RFC7231], that is identified by an URI.

2.  The Idempotency HTTP Request Header Field

   An idempotency key is a unique value generated by the client which
   the server uses to recognize subsequent retries of the same request.
   The "Idempotency-Key" HTTP request header field carries this key.

2.1.  Syntax

   The "Idempotency-Key" request header field describes








Jena & Dalal               Expires 15 May 2021                  [Page 3]

Internet-Draft      The Idempotency HTTP Header Field      November 2020


   Idempotency-Key       = idempotency-key-value

   idempotency-key-value = opaque-value
   opaque-value          = DQUOTE *idempotencyvalue DQUOTE
   idempotencyvalue      = %x21 / %x23-7E / obs-text
          ; VCHAR except double quotes, plus obs-text

   Clients MUST NOT include more than one "Idempotency-Key" header field
   in the same request.

   The following example shows an idempotency key using UUID version 4
   scheme:

   Idempotency-Key: "8e03978e-40d5-43e8-bc93-6894a57f9324"

2.2.  Uniqueness of Idempotency Key

   The idempotency key that is supplied as part of every "POST" request
   MUST be unique and can not be reused with another request with a
   different request payload.

   How to make the key unique is up to the client and it's agreed
   protocol with the server.  It is "RECOMMENDED" that "UUID" or a
   similar random identifier be used as the idempotency key.

2.3.  Resource Behavior

   How an idempotency key is made unique key is determined by the
   client.  We "RECOMMEND" using "UUID" or similar random string with
   enough entropy to avoid collisions.

   The resource SHOULD save the resulting "HTTP" status code and body of
   the first request made for any given idempotency key, regardless of
   whether it succeeded or failed.  Subsequent requests with the same
   key "MUST" return the same result, including errors.

   It is also recommended that the resource implements the idempotency
   keys to be time-based and, thus, be able to purge or delete a key
   upon its expiry.  Resource SHOULD publish expiration policy related
   documentation.

2.4.  Error Scenarios

   If the "Idempotency-Key" request header is missing for a documented
   idempotent operation requiring this header, the resource MUST reply
   with an "HTTP" "400" status code with body containing a link pointing
   to the relevant documentation.  Alternately, using the "HTTP" header
   "Link", client could be informed about the error too as shown below.

Internet-Draft      The Idempotency HTTP Header Field      November 2020


   HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
   Link: <https://developer.example.com/idempotency>;
     rel="describedby"; type="text/html"

   If there is an attempt to reuse an idempotency key with a different
   request payload, the resource MUST reply with an "HTTP" "422" status
   code with body containing a link pointing to the relevant
   documentation.  Using the "HTTP" header "Link", client could be
   informed about the error as following.

   HTTP/1.1 422 Unprocessable Entity
   Link: <https://developer.example.com/idempotency>;
   rel="describedby"; type="text/html"

   For other errors, the resource MUST return the appropriate status
   code and error message.

3.  IANA Considerations

3.1.  The Idempotency-Key HTTP Request Header Field

   The "Idempotency-Key" request header should be added to the permanent
   registry of message header fields (see [RFC3864]), taking into
   account the guidelines given by HTTP/1.1 [RFC7231].

   Header Field Name: Idempotency-Key

4.  Implementation Status

   Note to RFC Editor: Please remove this section before publication.

   This section records the status of known implementations of the
   protocol defined by this specification at the time of posting of this
   Internet-Draft, and is based on a proposal described in [RFC7942].
   The description of implementations in this section is intended to
   assist the IETF in its decision processes in progressing drafts to

   RFCs.  Please note that the listing of any individual implementation
   here does not imply endorsement by the IETF.  Furthermore, no effort
   has been spent to verify the information presented here that was
   supplied by IETF contributors.  This is not intended as, and must not
   be construed to be, a catalog of available implementations or their
   features.  Readers are advised to note that other implementations may
   exist.

   According to RFC 7942, "this will allow reviewers and working groups
   to assign due consideration to documents that have the benefit of
   running code, which may serve as evidence of valuable experimentation
   and feedback that have made the implemented protocols more mature.
   It is up to the individual working groups to use this information as
   they see fit".

5.  Security Considerations

   This section is meant to inform developers, information providers,
   and users of known security concerns specific to the HTTP conditional
   request mechanisms.  More general security considerations are
   addressed in HTTP "Message Syntax and Routing" [RFC7230] and
   "Semantics and Content" [RFC7231].

   The validators defined by this specification are not intended to
   ensure the validity of a representation, guard against malicious
   changes, or detect man-in-the-middle attacks.  At best, they enable
   more efficient ...? when all participants are behaving nicely.  At
   worst, the conditions will fail and the client will receive a
   response that is no more harmful than an HTTP exchange without
   conditional requests.

   An entity-tag can be abused in ways that create ? risks.

6.  Examples

   The first example shows an idempotency-key header field with key
   value using UUID version 4 scheme:

   Second example shows an idempotency-key header field with key value
   using some random string generator:

   Idempotency-Key: "clkyoesmbgybucifusbbtdsbohtyuuwz"
